This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the Application

To start the Next.js application and the API server concurrently, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server for the API. This command will start the API server for the application. It will run in the background, so keep this terminal window open:

```bash
npm run json-server
```

3. In another command line window, build the application:

```bash
# Build the project:
npm run build
# Start the application:
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
